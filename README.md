### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was always curious about how the things work, how to build things. And programming allows me to do that. To build things, starting from scratch and see it working at the end. It is so satisfying. 

#### Work, work, work :sparkles:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a front end developer for the <a href="https://www.breachsecurenow.com">Secure Now</a> with the react universe.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning redux, how to use ui-material :nail_care: designs, react admin, and so on..

#### Let's have some fun :grin: !

- :dog: I love dog's, and animals in general.
- :earth_americas: I hope some day the world will be a better place to live.
- :camera: I love movies and series.. I :heart: Netflix.
- :world_map: I want to travel around.
